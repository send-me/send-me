			The power of rhetoric lies not just in its analytic or productive capacities, but
in its emphasis on pedagogy. If we can build effective theories about how to
use and construct digital media for the accomplishment of persuasive enterprises,
we can also teach those theories and the rhetorical practices derived
from those theories. Classical rhetoric, the starting point of my project, is
deeply concerned with teaching; from Protagoras’s insistence that the art
of persuasion can be taught to Quintilian’s codification of the pedagogy of
classical rhetoric, every explication of rhetorical theory has included a pedagogical
foundation. This, too, is why rhetoric is best suited for developing a
framework of understanding for digital media. Robert Coover (1999) neatly
sums up the importance of rhetoric to digital production and pedagogy:
Rhetoric, in this Age of the New Sophists, is still the route to power, but
the hypertextual link and all the visual and aural media are now part of its
grammar. Like composers, artists, and filmmakers before them, writers
will learn to battle through the new tool-learning tasks, or to collaborate
with other artists, designers, filmmakers, composers, and the tools themselves
will become easier to learn and use and will interact more smoothly
with other tools. (n.p.)
One of the first projects that I worked on as a graduate student at Michigan
State University was an article on teaching digital rhetoric that was produced
by a collective that we alternately called DigiRhet.org or DigiRhet.net (I favored the latter, but in our first publication, the attribution is listed as the .org
variant). The idea for the formation of the group (and much of the content of
our first publication) came from the first Digital Rhetoric graduate course at
MSU, taught by Dànielle DeVoss. We published “Teaching Digital Rhetoric:
Community, Critical Engagement, and Application” in the spring 2006 issue
of Pedagogy (the collective subsequently published “Old+Old+Old=New: A
Copyright Manifesto for the Digital World” in the summer 2008 “Manifesto”
issue of Kairos, but I was not one of the authors on that project). As the title
indicates, our approach to teaching digital rhetoric focused on three key elements
that we felt were foundational—understanding and developing a sense
of community (as it is engaged both online and in the classroom itself ), a focus
on critical engagement with the technologies of production and delivery,
and a method for developing facility with the applications that support the
production of digital texts.
Our approach specifically addresses rhetoric as both analytic and heuristic
for production; we argued that “digital rhetoricians must explore both
theory and technology; critical engagement alone is just as insufficient as
a curricular approach as would be practical application without the provision
of tools for understanding how technologies work within social and
cultural contexts” (249).
While I believe that the DigiRhet framework has value, it is not the only
approach to teaching digital rhetoric—other approaches range from teaching
multimodal composition and web design from a digital rhetoric perspective
to focusing on the theories and methods that constitute the field (aligned with
the theories and methods I have described in previous chapters). I have chosen
three courses that take different approaches to teaching digital rhetoric to
show how these differences might play out depending on whether the focus
is on the theories that undergird digital rhetoric or engaging in the development
of digital texts using digital rhetoric as a methodology. The courses I
have chosen are Sarah Arroyo’s graduate Seminar on Digital Rhetoric, taught
in spring 2009 at California State University, Long Beach; Byron Hawk’s undergraduate
Advanced Writing—Digital Rhetoric course taught in fall 2010 at
the University of South Carolina; and my own undergraduate course on Web
Authoring and Design, taught in spring 2011 at George Mason University.
These are of course not the only approaches to teaching digital rhetoric, and
many other examples are available.
